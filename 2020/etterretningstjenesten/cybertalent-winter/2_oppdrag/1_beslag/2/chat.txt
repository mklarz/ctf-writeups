[09:04] B4tCracK: Hi every1, i read that SecureChat was bought by some megacorp, don't think it's safe anymore. let's talk here instead
[09:40] RADAR: willco
[09:46] eireen89: You made this thing all by yourself?
[10:24] B4tCracK: just some stuff i had lying around from another project no big deal
[10:24] B4tCracK: it encrypts stuff six times, might be a bit slow
[11:23] RADAR: Wow, proper nation-state crypto stuff or what?
[11:57] eireen89: Hey, RADAR, remember: We're a proper nation-state too! Or at least we should be!

[16:51] hungry_hippo_123: but whats happening?
[16:52] eireen89: This fight is grand er than us and each one of us. Ask of yourselves: Are you in it for Antarctica, or just to avoid boredom?
[17:52] eireen89: The world is changing before our very eyes, and we must take a stand!
[17:53] eireen89: Just read this shit: https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=en&nv=1&pto=aue&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=auto&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/meld.-st.-32-20142015/id2415997/sec6%3Fq%3DAntarktis

[00:26] B4tCracK: I have devised a cunning method to book flight tickets anonymously. Our names will not show up anywhere except in the Sea the World systems.
[00:56] RADAR: W00t w00t
[01:28] B4tCracK: Yeah, I knew investing in this "relationship" would come in handy some day!

[03:01] RADAR: Speaking bout tickets
[03:01] RADAR: do we have a lock on the target yet?
[03:02] RADAR: Oh and we need a codename! How about "Hummingbird"
[04:40] eireen89: It is getting closer, now that we finally can get air tickets, the target can be some hot-shot norwie
[04:47] eireen89: Maybe someone who runs those subsea facilities
[05:14] hungry_hippo_123: We need a cooler name than hummingbird
[05:14] hungry_hippo_123: More action!!
[06:26] B4tCracK: There should be some adjective
[07:08] RADAR: Uh, isn't tactical stuff my responsibility, not yours?!
[07:09] B4tCracK: Operation FISHY PELICAN
[07:10] hungry_hippo_123: No, EXPLODING something!!
[07:11] B4tCracK: EXPLODING HUMMINGBIRD
[08:05] RADAR: OK, that one's actually good. OORAH!
